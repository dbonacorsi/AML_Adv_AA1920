Before running it, some explanations:\n","\n","* The model type that we will be using is **Sequential**, i.e. the easiest way to build a model in Keras. It allows you to build a model layer by layer, sequentially.\n","* We use the `add()` function to add layers to our model.\n","* Our first 2 layers are **Conv2D** layers. These are convolution layers that will deal with our input images, which are seen as 2D matrices.\n","   * the first Conv2D layer has 64 nodes\n","   * the second Conv2D layer has 32 nodes\n","* The # of nodes in a layer can be adjusted to be higher or lower, depending on the size of the dataset and of the type of problem to solve.\n","* `kernel_size` is the size of the filter matrix for our convolution. So a kernel size of 3 means we will have a 3x3 filter matrix.\n","* **Activation** is the activation function for the layer. We will be using the ReLU, or Rectified Linear Activation, proven to work just fine in most cases of NN applications.\n","* The 1st layer (and only that one) also takes in an input shape, i.e. the shape of each input image (28,28,1 as seen earlier).\n","* In between the Conv2D layers and the Dense layer, there is a **Flatten** layer, which serves as a connection between the convolution and dense layers.\n","* **Dense** is the layer type we will use for the output layer. It is a standard layer type that is used in many cases for NNs. This layer will have 10 nodes in our output layer, not unexpectedly given the problem: one for each possible outcome (0–9)!\n","* The activation function used in the Dense layer is **softmax**. It makes the output sum up to 1 so the output can be interpreted as probabilities. The model will then make its prediction based on which option has the highest probability.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"U1vGFsTlf3IW","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Flatten\n","\n","#create model\n","model = Sequential()\n","#add model layers\n","model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)))\n","model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))\n","model.add(Flatten())\n","model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"x6S-Vvtmf3IZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Now, we need to compile the model.
